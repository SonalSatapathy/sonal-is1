<h3>3 things I learned</h3>
<p>The first thing I learned was that Web 1.0 was the first stage of the World Wide Web revolution, usually referred to as read-only web. That was how the Internet we know today started in the first place, where the websites were merely informational and comprised entirely static content. Another thing is Web 2.0 was also called the read-write web and it was the phase when websites grew in terms of user interaction. It was the period when websites became more focused on user-generated content. I also learned that there are many different ways to make a website like the tried-and-true classic of hosting plain HTML files, static site generators, and content management systems of all flavors.</p>
