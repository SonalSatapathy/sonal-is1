<h3>Q2: From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas?</h3>

<p>Framing a project in a story format helps refine ideas by giving them a structure, clarity, and purpose. A story usually has a beginning, middle, and end, which helps you to think about the userâ€™s journey and how your project fits into it. By creating characters, showing their goals, and the challenges they face, you can identify the core problem your project is solving and ensure your solution directly addresses it. This approach also focuses on the gaps, inconsistencies, or unnecessary details that could weaken the overall vision. Overall, storytelling transforms abstract concepts into relatable experiences, making it easier to focus, prioritize, and communicate ideas effectively.</p>
