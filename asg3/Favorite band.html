	<p>I love this group because of their diverse range of sounds they create. They've done almost every genre in music so there is a chance that there's always something for everyone. They've done a lot of hip hop/R&B, rock, ballads, etc... Each member has done their own solo projects and all of them have unique sound. They produce like crazy with 2 to 3 albums every year and that's not including the EPs. Their work ethic is absolutely insane and they've recorded for songs during tours. The main reason I love them is that all of them are all-rounders meaning they can do everything from rapping to singing to dance.
