	<h1>Stray Kids</h1>
	<p>Stray Kids is a boy band formed by JYP Entertainment. They were formed through the 2017 JYP Entertainment reality show called "Stray kids", with leader Bang Chan handpicking the final nine members. The group debuted on March 25, 2018, with the digital single "District 9", but currently consists of eight members after Woojin's departure in 2019. Known for their self-produced music through the subunit 3RACHA (Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han), Stray Kids are a successful fourth-generation K-pop group, having achieved major chart success including topping the Billboard 200.  The band consists of eight members: Bang Chan, Lee Know, Changbin, Hyunjin, Han, Felix, Seungmin, and I.N.</p>

	<p>I love this group because of their diverse range of sounds they create. They've done almost every genre in music so there is a chance that there's always something for everyone. They've done a lot of hip hop/R&B, rock, ballads, etc... Each member has done their own solo projects and all of them have unique sound. They produce like crazy with 2 to 3 albums every year and that's not including the EPs. Their work ethic is absolutely insane and they've recorded for songs during tours. The main reason I love them is that all of them are all-rounders meaning they can do everything from rapping to singing to dance.
