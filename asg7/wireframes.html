	<h1>The Guide to Wireframing Questions</h1>
	<h2>Questions:</h2>
	<h3>Q1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
	<p>The advantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software is that sketching is fast, low overhead, and lets you capture ideas immediately without launching tools or worrying about precision. You can also iterate loosely, cross things out, redraw, scribble notes, do quick variations without “breaking” a layout. The disadvantages are hand-drawn sketches are less legible and harder to do especially in remote environments, and can’t be easily versioned or duplicated. It is also tedious to polish or adjust, you often have to redraw entire sections or pages.</p>
	
	<h3>Q2: Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>

	<p>For my project I think a mix between sketching out the wireframes and using a wireframe software would work bect since I would be able to do the initial sketch of how I want the wireframes to look and then do the actual wireframes digitally after I've sort of planned it out. I think this would work best because have the wireframes sketched out first allows be to be quicker with where I want things to go rather than spending time with figuring out how the software works. I can then translate the sketch and do the rest of the wireframes on the wireframe software.</p>
