	<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
	<h2>Chistopher Bahng</h2>
	<h3>Short bio</h3>
	<img src="images/Bangchan.jpg" align="left">

	<p>Christopher Chahn Bahng, is an Australian singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer. He's the leader and oldest member and a member of an in-house production team, 3Racha. Chris is also a Fendi brand ambassador. Chan's first taste of stardom came in high school when he sang the Australian national anthem at his performing arts school's graduation ceremony.</p>

	<p> I think he would made a pretty good ruler because he is a very responsible person. Having left his home at just 13, he learned pretty early on how to survive on his own and how to make a living on his own. He all had to try over and over for 7 years to make it in the company he was applying for. He created a group and made it unique by creating the logo to the people he chose to be in it. And leaving home and his family to an international country at 13 wasn't easy and he still didn't give up and learnt what it meant to be a great leader. He once mentioned that he wanted to be a leader to didn't lead and ordered people but instead a listener. Taking peoples ideas in and being very positive about it. I think he would lead a country pretty well since he is very mature.

	<aside>
		<p class="p">I think that Joshua would make a pretty good runner up since like the first candidate, he also moved from Los Angeles from a really young. He moved at 2012 at around 16 years old has had to struggle in a foreign place until he could make it in the agency. He had to try for years at a reality show where the angency would then pick people who would debut in their company. He is also very independent because of surviving in an international country on his own so he would be able to lead a country pretty good by the experiences he's faced.</p>

	<p class="p">Joshua has emerged as an unexpected style icon through his involvement in luxury fashion campaigns, particularly with the prestigious brand Tom Ford. His campaign presence highlights a refined, polished image—emphasizing classic elegance, understated charisma, and quiet confidence. Rather than relying on bold theatrics, Joshua’s platform in these campaigns communicates sophistication and subtle allure, aligning perfectly with Tom Ford’s aesthetic of sleek tailoring and timeless minimalism.</p>
