	<h1>Assignment 6</h1>
	<h2>Six thinking hats summary</h2>

	<h3>White Hat</h3>
	<p>The white hat covers the facts and what we know so far as well as asking questions. For my semester project, the problem is how to get to the location quickly in a short period of time. The information we have is the location we are trying to go and what type of transportation people normally use to get to those places and how long it takes. For example to a different state people might use an airplane for a couple hours or a car for a day or two. We still need to figure out the urgency of the trip, if it's for vacation or an emergency.</p>

	<h3>Red Hat</h3>
	<p>The red hat is based on the emotions and feelings behind this. To get people to their destination quickly we could have a zipline type transportation that hits a target and takes you directly to the place. You can select a place and the set time you want to reach by and it'll take you. That could work but I don't feel too confident on it. I feel like it maybe could work for short distances but would be a problem for longer distances. 
	
	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
	<p>The black hat is more on the downsides of what could go wrong. The problems that could come of having a zipline launched to the target location is that the zipline could break or there isn't any communication inside for people riding it since they're holding onto the zipline. The potential problem from that is that it wouldn't be the safest option for people riding it. 

	<h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
	<p>The yellow hat is things we can do to make this work and how we can improve it. We could add a cube for each individual that has wifi and can use internet. It would be better than an airplane since airplanes don't have wifi on the air. The zipline would also be through varius air tunnels. It would be like a train or subway but in the air. That would make it so it's safer for people riding it. We can also add air conditioning to making it comfortable for the passengers riding. We can also have a drone fly beside the zipline train to show the different pathways the passenger can take to reach the destination sooner. Or they have the option to take detours if they're not in a rush and the drone will update accordingly and show the pathways to return to the fastest route back.</p>

	<h3>Green Hat</h3>
	<p>The green hat is ideas to fix the problems in the black hat. To make the zipline not break we could make them go through the different tunnels so it would be much safer. People can also have internet inside the cubes since we added internet. Other alternatives we could add is seats so they don't have to hold onto the zipline and can communicate freely.</p>

	<h3>Blue Hat</h3>
	<p>The blue hat is the overview of everything. The subject is smooth transportation from one area to another that will take a short amount of time. We discussed how it's sometimes a hassle to go through the security of airports and how long the process is to fly to a different country or continent. We wanted to make it easier and quicker for people traveling so we made a zipline that travels through different tunnels and pathways in the air. It has different cubes that people can get in. The zipline hooks onto the place you are going to through a drone. That drone will fly beside your cube showing the map and different pathways that are the fastest to take to reach the destination. You can select a pathway you want for quick detours and the drone will send you back on the right path after you're done.

		<p class="section">My project has changed a lot from how I initially thought. At first I was going to make it less international and more domestic traveling but after I thought of creating a zipline through the tunnels, I felt like I could have it travel farther places. I also changed it by adding a drone and wifi after thinking about possible problems that could happen with a zipline. Since it would now travel farther, I thought it would need to be safer and more entertaining. I also thought that I should add cubes so it would add to the safety of the zipline tunnel.</p>
