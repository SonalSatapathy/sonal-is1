<h3>Q1: What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>

<p>The difference between a structured content and semantic HTML is a structured content is content that is "planned, developed, and connected outside an interface so that it’s ready for any interface.” A semantic HTML is markup that communicates information about meaningful relationships between document elements, as opposed to simply describing how they should look on screen.</p>

<h3>Q2: How do they work together?</h3>

<p>They work together by providing meaning and organization to web content, benefiting both human users and machines.</p>

<h3>Q3: Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>

<p>It is important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages because without structure and meaning, assistive technologies can't parse your content</p>

	<h3>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h3>

	<p>The most successful way to banish the troll for me would be to ignore it because I feel like that helps a lot more and shifting our focus and it changes how it affects us.</p>

	<h3>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h3>

	<p>Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait. One method he identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting is to have separate deadlines for all assignments. I think starting on assignments before the deadline would work best for me because even if I don't finish it at least I have the thought that I've started something rather than thinking I'm going to do it which ends up never happening.</p>

	<h3>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h3>

	<p>I don't have military power.</p>
