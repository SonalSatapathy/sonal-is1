	<p>The reason I chose this visual & interaction design to be in Osaka was because I loved that place in general. I also wanted to research more about that place since I heard a lot of tourists typically go there so I used this as an opportunity to do that. In the process, I was able to find different restaurants that a lot of people visit and the popular locations in Osaka. I found out the Osaka castle which looked really pretty when I was searching up pictures. Mostly all the location I saw looked super pretty and that's why I was more willing to make this the location for the destination website.</p>

	<p>The reason why I chose the color palete and images to be all pink was because when I looked up different times to go to visit Osaka it mentioned to go during the spring time which it when the sakura trees blossom. I realized that it would be a perfect match with the scenery and the background to have the pink color palate. I went along with pink theme and grabbed some pink sakura flowers to match the aesthetic. I also added them to make the homepage of the website more appealing.</p>
