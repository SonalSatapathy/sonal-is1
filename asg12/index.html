	<h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
	<p>I included these movies in this gallery because these are some of my favorite movie and I would say my all time favorite animated movies in terms of storytelling and art. I've noticed while picking these movies that most of these movies are directed by  Makoto Shinkai or are studio Ghibli films. I love Makoto Shinkai's work and he does a great job and telling a story that's full lof twists and have you waiting until the very end. It's unusual to get a direct happy ending in his movies so when it does happen it's a blessing. I love these movies also because of the beautiful art it has and amazing sceneries. I love wholesome while also sad type stories and that's why these are some of my favorite movies. I love fantasy stories and supernatural events that happen in these movies. Some of the movies are sadder and some are more fun and comedic.</p>
