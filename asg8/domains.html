	<h1>Assignment 8: Domain Names</h1>

	<h2>3 possible domain names:</h2>

	<ul>
		<li> tinydrones.org </li>
		<li> flightech.org </li>
		<li> soaringtunnels.org </li>

	
	<p>I chose these domain names for my website and tested them to see it was available. I found some that were pretty cheap like about 10-18 dollars. We duscussed each of the domain names and thought that each of them had a nice ring to it. The first one gives off a straight forward vibe and gets to the point of the website and people would know exactly what it is just by seeing it. It's also pretty easy to remember and short for people to type it out too. For the second domain names I thought of different ways to show the ability of the drone without outright telling it. Since it's about flighing I thought using flight and doing a word play where I combined the "t" of the end of flight and the beginning of tech. I thought it looked a bit off and didn't flow right when I just wrote it side by side so that's why I decided to merge them. For the last domain name I thought that I should try something different and try to incorperate the tunnels as well into the domain by coming up with soaringtunnels. We were talking about the different names and how they would stand out with my website.</p>

	<p>I liked the second domain name "flightech.org" because it sounds creative and flows when you say it. It is also easy to remember since it is short and makes sense in terms of the website. However I think the tech combined with the org doesn't sound right so I think overall I like the third domain name. I liked it because it shows what the website is as well as another aspect of it. I think the first one is too direct so "soaringtunnels.org" is a nice way to show the website without be too direct.</p>
